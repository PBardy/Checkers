### How to play

The red player starts first. Clicking on the circular pieces should highlight the tile beneath. This indicates that the piece on that tile has been selected. Once a piece has been selected, clicking on any other tile that represents a valid move will cause the piece to move to that location.

If you mistakedly select the wrong piece, simply make an invalid move and this will deselect the piece. The easiest way to do this is to simply click on the piece again. 

## Roadmap

* Add a game win screen
* Add a game loss screen
* Add automatic win/loss detection
* Optimise the game for mobile use
* Implement an adapted minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning as a player AI
